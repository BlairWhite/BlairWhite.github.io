How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
-I was sick over the weekend and was unable to complete this assignment with a pair. Working with someone else might have helped me get more creative with my wireframe, or to learn new semantic elements.
Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
-Wireframing forces you to consider how people will interact with your site. I thought about practical uses first, and then about how I could make my site more aesthetically pleasing.
What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
-I tried to keep this wireframe very simple. When reading tech blogs, I prefer those that don't go over the top with their layout, and I tried to replicate that with mine.
What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
I did not use any new semantic elements in this wireframe.
