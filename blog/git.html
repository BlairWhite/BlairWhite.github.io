        Week 1 of DBC introduced the command line, version control, and working with git/GitHub. The "command line" is Unix software that allows the user to interact with the computer's operating system. On OSX, it functions much the same way that the Finder application does, but it allows an experienced user to perform more complicated tasks with greater efficiency. As part of this section we learned the shell commands that allow a user to use the shell to manipulate their operating system.

        Next, we learned about the idea of version control. In simple terms, version control is any system that allows a user or group of users to monitor progress on a project by saving a copy of the project at each stage, and recording what changes are made to it and when. Version control is very useful to programmers because it allows them to track the evolution of their thought process as they work through a project, and to make changes to sections of code without the worry of losing the earlier version or writing over it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Git is software located locally on your computer that allows programmers to perform version control. Git has a feature called a commit, which is equivalent to a "save" or "snapshot" of your code. When you commit code in  git, the code is immortalized in its current state, allowing you to refer back to it later.
      </p>
      <p>
        When working on a programming project with a group, GitHub is an immensely useful resource. GitHub is similar to Git in that it allows users to perform version control. Unlike git, which is software located on your local computer, GitHub is an online hub where files of code can be shared and simultaneously edited by a group. GitHub is home to a "master branch", or main version of code, which can be forked (copied and downloaded) by members of the group, who can then edit it and request to resubmit their version (branch) back to the main branch on GitHub. Before the code is accepted to the master branch, other members of the group can review the code and make sure the changes/additions made by the one user are ones they want in their main branch. This prevents one person's unwanted changes from damaging the main branch.
