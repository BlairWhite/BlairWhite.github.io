       An array is a list of items contained in square brackets, separated by commas. Arrays can contain mixed types of items, including floats, integers, strings, and lists. Each item in the array has an 'index' number that can be used to point to that individual item. The first item in the array has index 0, and they are counted upwards. For example in the array [salt, pepper, oregano], salt has index 0, pepper has 1, and so on. These items are accessed with the notation array[#index number] ie array[0] would access salt. This can prove difficult for accessing items at the end of a long array, so there is another notation that uses negative index numbers: the last item in an array is array[-1], the second to last; array[-2], and so on. Methods can return an array, or add to them, or modify items in them. The .each method is very useful when dealing with arrays, as it moves through them one item at a time and evaluates each index position.

      A hash is a collection of key-value pairs. This means that it consists of 'keys' or the names that refer to values, and the actual values themselves. The syntax for has elements is "key" => "value". They are similar to arrays in that they can contain any type of element, but instead of index numbers, you can refer to elements in them by using the "key" name. The syntax for this is as follows: hash.[key] where 'hash' is the name of the hash, and 'key' is the key name - this will access the value associated with the key. Attempting to access a value with an invalid key, Ruby will return 'nil." Hashes can accept any type of element (float, integer, array, etc) as either a key or a value. A new hash can be created with the notation: hashname = hash.new.
