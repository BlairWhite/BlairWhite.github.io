    <h2>Classes vs. IDs</h2>

        A fundamental part of CSS is being able to describe HTML elements so that you can then refer back to them when you are styling your page. While this can sometimes be done using more general selectors like a, p, and div, or with more specific methods like nth-child, being able to target specific elements can get complicated on long pages with an abundance of code. Thankfully, there are two more simple options: classes and IDs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both classes and IDs are placed into the opening of an HTML tag.While the syntax is much the same for both, there is a key difference in how IDs and classes are used: ID's are unique, meaning each element can only have one ID, and each page can have only one element with that ID. Classes are not unique; each element can have multiple classes, and each page can have various elements that belong to the same class. The image below shows that an element can only have one ID, but can have multiple classes, and also that an element can have both a class and an ID.
      </p>
      <p>
        In CSS, there is no difference between the styling you can do with an ID vs a class. However, IDs can be used in a browser to locate specific elements. When searching something, say "example.com#findelementwiththisid," your browser will return the element on that page with the ID 'findelementwiththisid.'
