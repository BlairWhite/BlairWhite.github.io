      <h3>
        Enumerable Methods: #map
      </h3>
      <h4>

        A look at the #map method for enumerables.
      </h4>
      <p>
       I chose to focus on the enumerable method '#map' for this week's blog post. I encountered #map multiple times this week while researching methods to use with arrays and hashes, and decided to dedicate my blog post to it because it is extremely useful when working with enumerables.
     </p>
     <p>
       The function of #map is to return a new array with the results of running 'block' for every element in enum (it works exactly like the #collect method, only the name is different). #Map seems very simple, but it is very useful if you want to perform some type of work on the elements in enum. It is important to note that .map leaves the original array unchanged, but .map! alters the original array.
      </p>
      <p>
        The syntax for #map is as follows for arrays: map { |obj| block } → array. For hashes, the syntax is similar, but in that case you have two inputs to work with for your block: map {|k, v| block using k or v}.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below are some practical use cases for .map.
        Array = [1, 2, 3, 4]
        Array.map {|x| x * x} #returns {1, 4, 9, 16}
        Arr = ["ohio", "florida", "iowa"]
        Arr.map {|z| z.capitalize #returns ["Ohio", "Florida", "Iowa"]
        Hash1 = [['bananas', 2], ['oranges', 6]]
        Hash1.map {|k, v| v.to_s} #returns [['bananas', '2'], ['oranges', '6']]
        Hash1.map {|k, v| k.capitalize} #returns [['Bananas', 2], ['Oranges', 6]]
      <p>
        As you can see above, .map allows you to perform a function on every element (or just one of a key/value pair in the case of a hash) across an entire enum. The concept of mapping is also helpful when working with other Ruby methods. Take #sort_by, for example (syntax: sort_by { |obj| block } → array). The description of the #sort_by method is as follows: "Sorts enum using a set of keys generated by mapping the values in enum through the given block." What this means is that the #sort_by function is using the same basic premise of #map - it applies the argument in the block position to every element in the enum, only #sort_by goes one step further and returns the resulting array in orderafter it has been sorted.
