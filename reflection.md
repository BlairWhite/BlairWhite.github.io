What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
>I had no prior experience in CSS so the entire concept of padding/borders/margins was all new to me. Padding is the space around the element, inside the border. The border is the actual boundary of the element. Margin is the space around the border. All can be manipulated in CSS.

What did you learn about CSS positioning?
>I learned the multiple ways you can position elements - relative, fixed, and absolute.

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
>Changing the appearance of the text and color was the easiest part. The toolbar was the most difficult aspect. I want the bar to be simultaneously linear-block and fixed positioning so it follows the user as they scroll. I was unable to accomplish this.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
> I learned that CSS allows you to add and format any imaginable element. It is very customizable and I didn't have too tough of a time picking up the syntax and identifying the variables that I wanted to change.
